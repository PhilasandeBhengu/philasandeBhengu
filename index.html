      <section id="About"><h1>About me</h1>
    <p>As a 14-year-old web developer with just six months of hands-on experience, I’ve already delved deep into the world of coding, immersing myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. What started as a curiosity quickly evolved into a passion as I’ve built and refined several personal projects, from simple websites to more complex interactive applications. My journey has involved not just learning the technical skills but also understanding how to design user-friendly interfaces and solve real-world problems through code. Despite my age, my enthusiasm and dedication drive me to continually experiment with new techniques and technologies, aiming to create innovative and engaging web experiences. My goal is to blend creativity with functionality, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead in my web development journey.
